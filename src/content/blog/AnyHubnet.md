What is this?

[AnyHub](/blog/anyhubnet) is a fast, free and simple file host that anyone can use. You don’t even need to signup!
How large can an individual file be?

You may upload files of up to 10 GiB at a time.
How long do files stay on the server for?

Files uploaded will generally be kept forever, unless they are in violation of our Terms of Service.
Why is this service free?

Bandwidth and hard drives are pretty cheap these days, so we thought that we’d do something positive for the entire Internet community to enjoy. As part of this, we’re dedicated to providing a pleasant service that doesn’t get in your way, unlike alternatives such as RapidShare or MegaUpload.
Will AnyHub ever become a paid service?

At the end of the day, we have to remain profitable to survive. If it becomes necessary, we may introduce a premium offering at some point, however the features you’re currently enjoying will always remain free.
Who’s behind this?

AnyHub is developed and run by Charlie Somerville, a student from Melbourne, Australia. The awesome design was created by Matt Anderson, a talented graphics designer from Ohio.
